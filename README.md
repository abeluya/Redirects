# Redirects
The redirect tester tool is an app developed to test the redirects and its response codes. The main idea of the application is to make easier to check a list of redirects by automating most of the process.

# How it Works
This software takes a list of redirects from the clipboard and then compare origin URLs against destiny URLs.

# Additional notes
* This application runs with Selenium Web driver, so it is necessary to have the Chrome driver installed in the same path of the app.
* It is highly recommended to create a back up of your "hosts" file before start using the application. 
* Also, please add a line break at the end of the "hosts" file. There is a unknown issue when editing this file so adding the line break will prevent the file gets corrupted. In case you need it, this is the path of the "hosts" file: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc

# Prerequisites
* A computer running on Windows 10, 8 or 7.
* At least 35MB of RAM memory.
* 25MB of free hard disk space.
* Internet connection.

# Using the application
The use of this application was intended to automate the test of redirects. To complete this, the app will need, as minimum, one source and one destiny IP.
